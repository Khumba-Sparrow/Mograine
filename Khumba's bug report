Hi we did and uld10 on the 25th of april 2021 and we encountered an intresting bug

Description:
Tank rolled need on tanking sword and the priest won the roll whit disenchant

How to reproduce:
the tanking sword called Stoneguard droped from Kologarn. Our tank called Sacredgrace rolled need, 
while i(Khumba) rolled disenchant and our rogue(Modison) rolled greed, what happened is, that instead of Tank winning the sword whit need i won it whit disenchant

How it should work:
If someone rolls need the game should give it to him instaed of item going for disenchant
